Paradise was ruled with the hand of science, and the hand was that of the galactic governing body known as the Core. Ironically, it was the Core's ultimate victory, the victory over death itself, that brought about the downfall of its paradise and started the war that would decimate a million worlds. The immortality process, known as \"patterning,\" involved the electronic duplication of brain matrices, allowing the transfer of consciousness into durable machines. Effectively it meant immortality, and the Core decreed the process mandatory for all citizens in order to ensure their safety. However, there were many citizens unwilling to toss aside their bodies so casually, many indeed who regarded patterning as an atrocity. They fled to the outer edges of the galaxy, forming a resistance movement that became known as the Arm. War began, though it was never officially declared by either side. The Arm developed high-powered combat suits for its armies, while the Core transferred the minds of its soldiers directly into similarly deadly machines. The Core duplicated its finest warriors thousands of times over. The Arm countered with a massive cloning program. The war raged on for more than 4,000 years, consuming the resources of an entire galaxy and leaving it a scorched wasteland.

The player takes the role of a military officer, issuing strategic commandings to his / her squad, then watching the resulting battle unfold. Games are started by players sending out Challenges to anybody they know - either exisiting Naked War players in their in-game address book, or real life friends or acquiantences via their email address list. Each player takes it in turn to plan the movement of their four units. Each unit is allowed up to seven 'moves' per turn, and can move, attack, enter buildings, drive tanks and other vehicles or use items, etc., each move. Once the player has set up all the moves for their four units, he / she clicks the send button, which sends an email to their opponent containing this turn (in the form of an attached file), then plays back the turn on their PC, showing both players the results of the planned moves. When a player receives a turn in their email Inbox, they simply double click the attachment to launch Naked War, which plays back the turn received then allows the player to set up their own turn in reply. Each soldier in the game starts with a 'doofer', but looses it to their attacker if the damage inflicted is great enough to 'demob' the soldier, losing their uniform and making them naked! The aim of the game is for one team to defeat the other by gaining control of all the doofers, and the winner is declared at the end of the turn where the last doofer changes hands. Each turn is played offline at whatever time is convenient to the player. There is no need for both players to be on-line at the same time, or playing at the same time. Turns can be replied to instantly, during lunchtime, or at the end of the day, or they can wait in your Inbox for days until the you are ready to respond. The average turns take only a few minutes to set up and play back, and a game can take anything from as little as 10 turns, up to 50 or more before there is a winner, depending on the complexity of the map and the relative skill of the players involved.

Join Naija, a lone underwater dweller in search of her family, as she explores the depths of Aquaria. She'll travel from hidden caves, shrouded in darkness, to beautiful, sunlit oases, all lovingly handcrafted by its two creators. Naija's story, narrated fully with voice overs, will become yours, as you join her on this magnificent adventure. Naija has the gift of the Verse. By singing songs, she can weave this force to change the waters around her. With each song Naija learns comes new abilities. With powerful songs, Naija is able to change form, giving players many options as to how to play the game. And with Aquaria's intuitive mouse-only control system, it's as easy to make Naija swim gracefully through the waters as it is to have her sing, cast spells, and engage in combat with the numerous dangerous creatures that inhabit Aquaria's waters.
